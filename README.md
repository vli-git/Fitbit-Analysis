# Fitbit-Analysis


## Description

The purpose of this analysis is to visualize Fitbit data using different methods to understand user behaviour, and to see whether there are any behavioural patterns that could improve overall health. 

The goals of this analysis are to:
1. Split users into groups based on active minutes
2. Hone in on specific groups and look at hourly activity
    - Look at activity patterns, sleeping patterns and identify differences across groups
3. Create visualizations to answer the following questions:
    - Are there differences in activity between groups by hour of the day? 
    - Are active users consistently more active during the day or do they have "peaks" of activity?
    - Are certain groups more active at night/in the morning?

## Datasets
This analysis used Kaggle's "FitBit Fitness Tracker Data" dataset.

The dataset is contained in the "Datasets" folder in a compressed zip file. To run the code, extract the folder within the zip file and change the filepath in the code accordingly.

## Code
- <b> EDA + Preprocessing.ipynb </b> contains the descriptive analysis and code used to create the datasets for analysis
- <b> Hourly Analysis.ipynb  </b> contains the visualizations comparing variables using hourly data
- <b> Daily Analysis.ipynb </b> contains the visualizations using daily data to compare user groups
